# Simulating Fluid Dynamics on Distributed Computers


* Disclosure: I have written this program in 2008. Both C++ and MPI versions usd to compile this code are definitly dated. I will rewrite it with updated versions and commit it here. This version is for my own recored. However, some people may still find  the cool idea I used to solve this problem interesting.
